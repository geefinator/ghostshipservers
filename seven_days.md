## Ghostship Seven Days to Die

Welcome to the Ghostship Seven Days to Die Server web page.  This server is a
30 slot (mostly) pve server.  PvP is disabled and punishable with prison time if
done outside an event.  We will be running Arena pvp events among other things
once we have the population to support it.  This server is brand new, so this is
the perfect chance to get a fresh start on a dedicated MP server!

Hostname: 7dtd.ghostship.org

Port: 26900

## Rules

1. No spamming chat for free stuff in you are new, work for it like everyone else
before you has.
2. No pvp unless it is during a PVP event.
3. No racial slurs or hate speech in chat or names.

## Features

Ghostbot (our botman install) is installed which provides a ton of things
to the server, just to list some:

* In game currency (Zennies) gotten by killing zombies.

* In game store to buy things from using Zennies (food, meds etc)

* Locations (Points of Interest) that players are able to teleport to.

* Chat functionality to support private messages.

* Anticheat and Hacking detection and auto banning.

* Vast admin command functionality to assist players who run into glitches.

* Ability to set reset zones which prevent building and allow for weekly resets
places like large cities and towns.

## About the admin
